# luciole ðŸ”¥ðŸª°

luciole (French for firefly) is an attempt at building a collaborative epub annotation webapp. It seeks to provide a reading environment on the web that allows two or more friends to read an epub with a rich suite of annotation tools that update live as they occur. No promises this ever gets finished. 

## List of things to do  
```
open epub/zip files ............... in progress
web based ereader ................. not started
annotation ........................ not started
backend database .................. not started
users and authentification ........ not started
live annotation updates ........... not started
```

Everything below was autogenerated by Gleam. Keeping them here for now even though I suspect I'll probably just delete it in the future.
